Software Verification, Validation and Security — Coursework Repository

This repository contains the exercises, lab implementations, and practice studies I completed as part of my Software Verification, Validation and Security course.

All materials here reflect my own hands-on work throughout the semester, including weekly lab tasks, testing examples, and solution attempts. I use this repository to track my progress, document what I learn, and demonstrate my practical understanding of verification and testing concepts.

Note: This repository is dedicated only to coursework and learning exercises. A separate repository with a similar name is used for the main project developed within the course.

📌 Purpose of this repository:

- Practice software testing principles in code
  
- Experiment with verification techniques
  
- Improve code quality awareness
  
- Showcase my learning process and technical growth

This repo represents my learning journey rather than a finished product, and it evolves as I continue improving my skills.
